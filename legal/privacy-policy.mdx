We employ industry-standard security measures to protect customer data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Customer data is transmitted and stored using encryption protocols to ensure its confidentiality.

We will follow legal provisions and regulations strictly, and will take strict and secure protective measures to safeguard your rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below:

- **Companies within our corporate group** who process your personal information in order to respond to your enquiries. All related group companies may only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We have information security and access policies that limit access to our systems and technology, and we protect data through the use of technological protection measures such as encryption.
