When you use our services, your personal data will be collected and processed directly in United States. Whenever we transfer personal information to other jurisdictions, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable data protection laws.

We employ industry-standard security measures to protect customer data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Customer data is transmitted and stored using encryption protocols to ensure its confidentiality.

We will follow legal provisions and regulations strictly, and will take strict and secure protective measures to safeguard your rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share personal information only as described below:

- **Companies within our corporate group** who process your personal information in order to respond to your enquiries. All related group companies may only use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
- **Third-Party Service Providers.** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include: sending communications, processing payments, assessing compliance risks, analyzing data, providing marketing and sales assistance (including advertising and event management), conducting customer relationship management, and providing training. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable data protection law.
- **Regulators, judicial authorities and law enforcement agencies, and other third parties for safety, security, or compliance with the law.** There are circumstances in which we are legally required to disclose information about you to authorities, such as to comply with a legal obligation or processes, enforce our terms, address issues relating to security or fraud, or protect our customers. These disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant. We are usually prohibited from notifying you of any such disclosures by the terms of the legal process. Where permitted, we will notify you of such disclosure.

  We may seek your consent to disclose information in response to a governmental entity's request when that governmental entity has not provided the required subpoena, court order, or search warrant.

## 4. The Security of Your Personal Information

We are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your personal information no matter where it is stored. We have information security and access policies that limit access to our systems and technology, and we protect data through the use of technological protection measures such as encryption.

Unfortunately, although we have implemented and maintained reasonable measures to protect your personal information, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.

## 5. Data Retention

We keep your personal information to enable your continued use of Glows.ai Offerings, for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Policy, as may be required by law (including for tax and accounting purposes), or as otherwise communicated to you. How long we retain specific personal information varies depending on the purpose for its use, and we will delete your personal information in accordance with applicable law. *For information you provide to us when submitting the enquiry form or contacting us using the details specified in this Privacy Policy*: until your enquiry is resolved, and then erased within 183 days of such resolution, unless you agree to have this data retained and receive more information in the future.
