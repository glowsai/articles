# End-User License Agreement

**Please read carefully before accessing or using Glows.ai ("Glows.ai") service ("Service"):**

This end-user license agreement ("**EULA**") is a legal agreement between (a) you (either an individual or a single entity) and (b) Glows.ai. that governs your use of any product, installed on or made available by glows for use as a standalone product or with your Glows.ai product ("**Product**") that is not otherwise subject to a separate license agreement between you and Glows.ai or its suppliers. The product includes application software, firmware, operating systems, drivers, and any other types of software and may include associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation.

An amendment or addendum to this EULA may accompany the Glows.ai product or the Product. In the event of a conflict between any such amendment or addendum and this EULA, the terms of the amendment or addendum shall control.

Rights in the Product are offered only on the condition that you agree to all terms and conditions of this EULA. By creating an account, accessing, installing, copying, downloading, using the Service or otherwise using the Product, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not accept these license terms, your sole remedy is to return the entire unused product (hardware and software), to cancel your subscription or cease using the Service within 14 days for a refund subject to the refund policy of your place of purchase.

This EULA is a global agreement and is not specific to any particular country, state or territory. If you acquired the Glows.ai product or the Product as a consumer within the meaning of relevant consumer legislation in your country, state or territory, then despite anything to the contrary in this EULA, nothing in this EULA affects any non-excludable statutory rights or remedies that you may have under such consumer legislation; this EULA is subject to those rights and remedies.

B. **SLA compensation:** If Glows.ai fails to meet the availability standards outlined in the service level agreement ("SLA"), customers are entitled to request an extension of service time or additional resources as compensation, instead of a refund.
