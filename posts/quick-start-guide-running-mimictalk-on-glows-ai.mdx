**MimicTalk** is a powerful text-to-speech (TTS) tool designed to generate natural, lifelike speech. Leveraging cutting-edge TTS technology, MimicTalk supports multiple languages, tones, and extensive customization options, making it ideal for virtual assistants, content creation, and educational applications.

With **Glows.ai**, you can easily run MimicTalk in a high-performance cloud environment, eliminating the need for complex installations and configurations. This guide walks you through setting up and accessing MimicTalk with multiple connection options (HTTP and SSH).

# **Step-by-Step Instructions**

## **Step 1: Log in to Glows.ai and Launch the MimicTalk Environment**

1. **Sign up and log in** Visit [Glows.ai](https://glows.ai/), register for an account, and log in.
2. **Launch the MimicTalk environment** On the dashboard, locate the **MimicTalk** task template and click “Complete Checkout.” Glows.ai will automatically allocate resources and set up dependencies for you.

## **Step 2: Access the MimicTalk Environment**

Once the environment is launched, you can access it using the following methods:

**1. HTTP WebUI (Port 7860)**

This is the main MimicTalk web interface for generating speech.

- Open the URL:
- plaintext
- [`https://tw-03.access.glows.ai:24527?token=iOuz4vDMME`](https://tw-03.access.glows.ai:24527/?token=iOuz4vDMME)
- The interface is user-friendly and allows you to input text and adjust voice parameters easily.

**2. SSH Access (Port 22)**

SSH provides command-line access to the backend environment for advanced operations.

- SSH Command:
- `ssh user@<your-instance> -p 22`
- **Password**: Refer to the instance details in your Glows.ai dashboard.
